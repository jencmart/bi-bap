\chapter{Introduction}
Goal of this thesis is to research currently used algorithms for calculation Least trimmed squares. Least trimmed squares was first introduced in 1984 and since that time couple of researchers came up couple of solutions. Beside that we'll propose extension of current algorithms which was never used before. We'll show that this updated algorithm is fast enough and also gives same or better results than currently used algorithms. We'll also compare speed  and performance of this algorithms on various data sets both from literature and also using our custom data generator which provides very flexible way of generating data with outliers. 
We'll extend all those algorithms and implement all of them both in C++ an python. 
We'll implement python library with C++ bac end which will provide all of the currently used algorithms.

In first chapter we'll introduce linear regression and ordinary least squares method and it's downfalls. We'll introduce robust statistic and methods of evaluating robust models.
In second chapters we'll analyze all of the algorithms together with is time complexity etc

\subsection{Conclusion}
There is still lot of future works on least trimmed squares. Proof of couple of thoughts is still about to come.
