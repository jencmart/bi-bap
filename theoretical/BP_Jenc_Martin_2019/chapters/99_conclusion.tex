To date, multiple exact and probabilistic algorithms for calculating LTS estimate has been proposed.
Those algorithms have been proposed across the last few decades. Most recently proposed algorithms are just a few years old. That means that research in the filed of LTS algorithms is still prevalent.

Although to date exact finite algorithm has polynomial time, we showed that currently used probabilistic algorithm provide sufficiently fast solutions which, even though are not exact, are good enough. Though it is proven that the exact solution cannot be obtained faster than in polynomial time, we showed that currently used algorithms could be combined to obtain better results. 


Algorithms for calculating the LTS estimate is an exciting topic for further research. One of the ways is the research of combining exact algorithms with probabilistic ones. As our experimental results prompt, we would possibly propose probabilistic algorithms which provide even better solutions at the same time.

Another way would be to use algorithms for computing LTS estimate on different robust statistic methods because some of them are very similar to LTS problem. Just put there are still a lot of future works on least trimmed squares, and we are planning to research this in the future.
