# How to run this?
* we need to compile cpp code
* currently (developing) we are using cppimport
* simply run python3 test.py
* cppimport'll auto compime && import cpp code to test.py
* somefile.so (compiled code) will be created
    * feel free to delete it (test.py will complie it again)
* test.py use path to eigen headers, so be sure to have them in correct directory
* main.py is used only for testing some pure python stuff
