We have surveyed, implemented, and described multiple exact and probabilistic algorithms for calculating the LTS estimate. 
Those algorithms have been proposed across the last few decades. Most recently proposed algorithms are just a few years old. This means that research in the field of LTS algorithms is still ongoing.

Although the exact algorithms have polynomial time complexity, we showed that currently used probabilistic algorithm provide sufficiently fast solutions which, even though that may not be exact, are good enough. Even though it was proven that the exact solution could not be obtained faster than in polynomial time, we showed that the currently used algorithms could be combined to obtain better results.

Algorithms for calculating the LTS estimate are still the open topic for further research. One of the possible research direction is to study the possibility of combining the exact algorithms with probabilistic ones. As our experimental results suggest, we could come up with probabilistic algorithms which provide even better performance.
